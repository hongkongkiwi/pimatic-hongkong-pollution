## Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)

### What is nitrogen dioxide?

Nitrogen dioxide is a nasty-smelling gas. Some nitrogen dioxide is formed naturally in the atmosphere by lightning and some is produced by plants, soil and water. However, only about 1% of the total amount of nitrogen dioxide found in our cities' air is formed this way.

Nitrogen dioxide is an important air pollutant because it contributes to the formation of photochemical smog, which can have significant impacts on human health.

The major source of nitrogen dioxide is the burning of fossil fuels: coal, oil and gas. Most of the nitrogen dioxide in cities comes from motor vehicle exhaust (about 80%). Other sources of nitrogen dioxide are petrol and metal refining, electricity generation from coal-fired power stations, other manufacturing industries and food processing.

### How does nitrogen dioxide affect human health?

The main effect of breathing in raised levels of nitrogen dioxide is the increased likelihood of respiratory problems. Nitrogen dioxide inflames the lining of the lungs, and it can reduce immunity to lung infections. This can cause problems such as wheezing, coughing, colds, flu and bronchitis.

Increased levels of nitrogen dioxide can have significant impacts on people with asthma because it can cause more frequent and more intense attacks. Children with asthma and older people with heart disease are most at risk.

## Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)

### What is sulfur dioxide?

Sulfur dioxide is a gas. It is invisible and has a nasty, sharp smell. It reacts easily with other substances to form harmful compounds, such as sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid and sulfate particles.

About 99% of the sulfur dioxide in air comes from human sources. The main source of sulfur dioxide in the air is industrial activity that processes materials that contain sulfur, eg the generation of electricity from coal, oil or gas that contains sulfur. Some mineral ores also contain sulfur, and sulfur dioxide is released when they are processed. In addition, industrial activities that burn fossil fuels containing sulfur can be important sources of sulfur dioxide.

Sulfur dioxide is also present in motor vehicle emissions, as the result of fuel combustion. In the past, motor vehicle exhaust was an important, but not the main, source of sulfur dioxide in air. However, this is no longer the case.

### How does sulfur dioxide affect human health?

Sulfur dioxide affects human health when it is breathed in. It irritates the nose, throat, and airways to cause coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, or a tight feeling around the chest. The effects of sulfur dioxide are felt very quickly and most people would feel the worst symptoms in 10 or 15 minutes after breathing it in.

Those most at risk of developing problems if they are exposed to sulfur dioxide are people with asthma or similar conditions.

## Ground-level Ozone (O3)

> In the context of air quality, the concern with ozone is the high levels that can occur at ground level.

### What are photochemical oxidants and ozone?

'Photochemical oxidants' is the technical term for the type of smog found in cities during the warmer months of the year. This type of smog can be invisible or it can appear as a whitish haze.

Photochemical oxidants are formed when sunlight falls on a mixture of chemicals in the air. Ozone is one of the main photochemical oxidants. Other chemicals such as formaldehyde are also found and, like ozone, have adverse health effects. Environment agencies measure the level of ozone because it indicates the total amount of photochemical oxidants in the air. Cities that have abundant sunshine over periods of time, together with moderate winds and high temperatures, are most likely to experience high levels of photochemical oxidants.

Ozone is a gas that is formed when nitrogen oxides react with a group of air pollutants known as 'reactive organic substances' in the presence of sunlight. (See fact sheet on air toxics.) The chemicals that react to form ozone come from sources such as: motor vehicle exhaust, oil refining, printing, petrochemicals, lawn mowing, aviation, bushfires and burning off. Motor vehicle exhaust fumes produce as much as 70% of the nitrogen oxides and 50% of the organic chemicals that form ozone.

The natural amount of ozone in the lower atmosphere is generally around 0.04 parts per million (ppm), and that amount is not harmful to human health. Vegetation can also emit organic chemicals that help form ozone. In Melbourne, up to 20% of these organic chemicals can come from vegetation and up to 64% in Brisbane.

### How does ozone affect human health?

Ozone can irritate the lining of the nose, airways and lungs. People who are exposed to enough ozone might feel some pain in their ears, eyes, nose and throat, and they might start to cough. Chest pains can also occur in some people. People with asthma might have more attacks and athletes might find it harder to perform as well as usual.

## Carbon Monoxide (CO)

### What is carbon monoxide?

Carbon monoxide is a gas and is found in air. High levels of carbon monoxide are poisonous to humans and, unfortunately, it cannot be detected by humans as it has no taste or smell and cannot be seen.

The natural concentration of carbon monoxide in air is around 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and that amount is not harmful to humans. Natural sources of carbon monoxide include volcanoes and bushfires.

The main sources of additional carbon monoxide are motor vehicle exhaust and some industrial activities, such as making steel.

Tobacco smoke is one of the main indoor sources of carbon monoxide.

### How does carbon monoxide affect human health?

Carbon monoxide affects healthy and unhealthy people. Increased levels of carbon monoxide reduce the amount of oxygen carried by haemoglobin around the body in red blood cells. The result is that vital organs, such as the brain, nervous tissues and the heart, do not receive enough oxygen to work properly.

No more than 2.5% of haemoglobin can be bound to carbon monoxide before some health effects become noticeable. At very high concentrations of carbon monoxide, up to 40% of the haemoglobin can be bound to carbon monoxide in this way. This level will almost certainly kill humans.

For healthy people, the most likely impact of a small increase in the level of carbon monoxide is that they will have trouble concentrating. Some people might become a bit clumsy as their coordination is affected, and they could get tired more easily.

People with heart problems are likely to suffer from more frequent and longer angina attacks, and they would be at greater risk of heart attack. Children and unborn babies are particularly at risk because they are smaller and their bodies are still growing and developing.

## Particles (PM2.5 & PM10)

### What are particles?

Airborne particles are sometimes referred to as 'particulate matter' or 'PM'. They include dust, dirt, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets. Some particles are large enough or dark enough to be seen as soot or smoke, while others are so small they can only be detected individually with a microscope.

Some particles are emitted directly into the air from a variety of sources that are either natural or related to human activity. Natural sources include bushfires, dust storms, pollens and sea spray. Those related to human activity include motor vehicle emissions, industrial processes (eg electricity generation, incinerators and stone crushing), unpaved roads and woodheaters.

Particles can be classified on the basis of their size, referred to as their 'aerodynamic diameter'. 'Coarse particles' are those between 10 and 2.5 micrometres (µm) in diameter; 'fine particles' are smaller than 2.5 µm; and 'ultrafine particles' are smaller than 0.1 µm. For comparison, the diameter of a human hair is 70 µm and this is seven times the diameter of the largest 'coarse particles'.

Particles can also be classified according to their chemical composition. The toxicity of particles is often dependent on their size and chemical composition.

### How do particles affect human health?

Studies have linked exposure to particle pollution to a number of health problems including respiratory illnesses (such as asthma and bronchitis) and cardiovascular disease. In addition, the chemical components of some particles, particularly combustion products, have been shown to cause cancer. These effects are often more pronounced for vulnerable groups, such as the very young and the elderly.

Particle pollution is the major cause of reduced visibility. This can be a serious safety issue on roads and in traffic tunnels and can also affect our enjoyment of the natural landscape.

## Air Quality Health Index (AQHI)

The Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) compiled by the Environmental Protection Department informs the public of the short-term health risk of air pollution in Hong Kong and helps the public take precautionary measures to protect their health.

### How the AQHI Works

The AQHI of the current hour is calculated from the sum of the percentage excess risk of daily hospital admissions attributable to the 3-hour moving average concentrations of four criteria air pollutants: ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and particulate matter (including PM10 and PM2.5 whichever has a higher risk) measured at each air quality monitoring station of the Environmental Protection Department. The risk factors associated with each pollutant were derived from local health statistics and air pollution data. The AQHIs are reported on a scale of 1 to 10 and 10+ and are grouped into five health risk categories.

### What the AQHI Reveals

The AQHI estimates the additional short-term health risk caused by air pollution of respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses that lead to hospital admissions. It makes reference to the short-term World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines as anchor points to define the level where health risk is high due to short term exposure to air pollution. The AQHIs are reported on a scale of 1 to 10 and 10+ and are grouped into five AQHI health risk categories with health advice provided.

Health Risk Category | AQHI
-------------------- | ----
Low                  | 1
Low                  | 2
Low                  | 3
Moderate             | 4
Moderate             | 5
Moderate             | 6
High                 | 7
Very High            | 8
Very High            | 9
Very High            | 10
Serious              | >10

When the health risk category is at the Low and Moderate levels, you can continue to enjoy your usual activities. When the category reaches High, children, the elderly and people with heart or respiratory illnesses should reduce outdoor physical exertion. When the category reaches Very High or Serious, the general public should also reduce or avoid outdoor physical exertion.
